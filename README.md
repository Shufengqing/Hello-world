# Hello-world
Hello, friends, this is my first repository on GitHub site. Programming is an interesting thing and I want to join you, too.
Accordnig to the GitHub Guides, I writed a bit about myself. But this kind of introduction should contain many contents so that I just write this simple sentence here. We will know each other more deeply in the futher. And at last, I focus on C++.
